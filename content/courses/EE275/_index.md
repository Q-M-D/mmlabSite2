title: üõ¥ Electric motor and motion control (EE275)
linkTitle: EE275 2023
summary: The course is arranged in a manner of "from theory to engineering". This is one essential core course to cover the four major courses, including electric machinery (steady state behaviors, winding design), ac machine transient analysis (mathematical modeling, numerical simulation), machine design (winding function, multi-phase machine theory, maxwell stress tensor), and motor control with an emphasis on engineering practices (controller tuning, inverter modeling). Lecture notes will be distributed online when ready.

## What you will learn

- {{<hl>}}Python{{</hl>}} programming skills
- Preparing homework in {{<hl>}}LaTeX{{</hl>}}
- Mathematic modeling of machines from groud up (from the well known theories in both math and physics)
- Control practices that are not taught in textbook.

## Program overview

The course is arranged in a manner of ‚Äúfrom theory to engineering‚Äù. This is one essential core course to cover the four major courses, including electric machinery (steady state behaviors, winding design), ac machine transient analysis (winding function, mathematical modeling, numerical simulation), machine design (advanced star of slots plot, multi-phase machine theory, maxwell stress tensor), and motor control (with an emphasis on engineering practices, e.g., system identification, commissioning, controller tuning, disturbance observer, inverter modeling).

Students are gonna get their hands dirty learning Python programming and numerical simulation skills along the way.

Lecture notes will be distributed online when ready.
